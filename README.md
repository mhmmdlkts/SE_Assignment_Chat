# Software Engineering Assignment 1

Implement a simple messaging system in Java where users can send messages to each other via
channels. A simple message contains only one text body or only one image. A multi-part message
contains a body text plus one or more attachments, where an attachment is a file or another
message. A sender may associate a confirmation receipt to a message, such that later it can check
if the message has been received. Use at least two design patterns and explain why they are
needed. Avoid using reflection, in particular do not use the instance of operator. Your
implementation must work with the following code snippet, as specified in the comments. Submit
only Java files (no class files, jars, pdfs, images, etc.)
